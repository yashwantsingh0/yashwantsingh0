# Welcome 

Hello! I'm a tech enthusiast from India, with a passion for a variety of subjects ranging from cybersecurity to woodworking, and cooking to fighter jets. I proudly call Arch Linux my operating system, and yes, I installed it myself.

My days are filled with exploration—whether it’s tinkering with the inner workings of tech, exploring the realms of physics and biology, or learning new survival skills. But when I'm not geeking out, I’m probably sleeping or cooking something delicious. To me, cooking is more than just a skill; it’s an art.

Movies and TV shows are my escape from reality. However, don't be surprised if I end up rewatching *The Office* for the 30th time instead of diving into my meticulously curated watchlist.

## My Interests

### Linux
I don’t just use Linux; I run Arch. Every time I boot up, I earn the right to feel just a little more smug than the average user.

### Movies and TV Series
I don't just watch movies and TV series; I curate my watchlist like it's the Criterion Collection. But honestly, I always seem to end up rewatching *The Office*—again.

### Cybersecurity
Let’s just say, I know my stuff. I’m not one to talk too much about it (for obvious reasons), but I’ve spent plenty of time diving deep into this field. You can check out my writings and thoughts over on my medium account.
